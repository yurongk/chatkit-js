# @xpert-ai/chatkit-browser-extension

Chrome Manifest V3 extension host for the Xpert ChatKit web component.

The extension provides two surfaces:

- Chrome side panel
- Page overlay injected on demand into the active HTTP(S) tab

Both surfaces render the same `xpertai-chatkit` web component and read their
configuration from `chrome.storage.local`.

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @xpert-ai/chatkit-browser-extension build
```

The Chrome extension is emitted to:

```text
packages/browser-extension/dist/chrome
```

Load that directory from `chrome://extensions` with Developer Mode enabled.

## GitHub Browser Extension Release Package

The `Package Browser Extension` workflow creates a GitHub Release package after
the root `Release` workflow succeeds on `main`. Add
`@xpert-ai/chatkit-browser-extension` to a changeset so `pnpm changeset version`
bumps the package version in the release PR before packaging.

The workflow only packages automatically when the package version changes. It
also supports manual dispatch for re-running the current version. In both cases,
it builds `dist/chrome`, uploads the zip as a GitHub Actions artifact, then
attaches the same zip to the `chatkit-browser-extension-v<version>` GitHub
Release. Publishing the zip to the Chrome Web Store is intentionally left for a
future workflow update.

## Configure

Open the extension options page and set:

- `frameUrl`
- `apiUrl`
- assistants: one or more published Assistant ID / Xpert ID entries, each with
  an optional display name and its own `Client Secret / API Key`, plus one
  active assistant
- launch mode (`Pet launcher` by default, or `Chat panel`)
- locale (`en` and `zh-Hans` are supported by the extension UI) and theme
- enabled surfaces
- automatic page pet launch on new HTTP(S) tabs
- page overlay size and position
- host page automation for agent client tools

Host page automation uses the Chrome `debugger` permission when available so it
can collect CDP snapshots and dispatch browser-level mouse/keyboard input. If
CDP is unavailable, the extension falls back to the content-script DOM executor.

The extension uses manual per-assistant credentials. It does not call Xpert APIs
directly and does not use native `fetch` to reach the platform. Instead, the
ChatKit options passed to the web component include `api.getClientSecret`, which
returns the stored `Client Secret / API Key` for the active assistant.

Existing extension configs that contain a legacy single `xpertId` and global
`clientSecret` are normalized into a one-item assistants list with that
credential the next time the config is read and saved. Existing multi-assistant
configs with a global `clientSecret` copy it into any assistant that does not yet
have its own credential.

## Local Frame Testing

For local ChatKit development, point `frameUrl` at a local Vite server such as
`http://localhost:5173/`. The generated Chrome manifest explicitly allows
extension pages to embed HTTP/HTTPS frame URLs with non-default ports, and adds
localhost host permissions for local testing.

If Chrome still shows a blocked-frame page, reload the unpacked extension after
building and confirm the local frame server is not sending `X-Frame-Options` or
`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` headers that prevent embedding.

## Development Checks

```bash
pnpm --filter @xpert-ai/chatkit-browser-extension type-check
pnpm --filter @xpert-ai/chatkit-host-automation test
pnpm --filter @xpert-ai/chatkit-browser-extension test
pnpm --filter @xpert-ai/chatkit-browser-extension build
```

## Browser Scope

Only Chrome MV3 is generated today. The source keeps Chrome-specific behavior
behind `src/platform/chrome` so future Edge or Firefox adapters can add their
own manifest and API shims without changing the ChatKit host code.
