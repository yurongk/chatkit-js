# Slash Commands

Slash commands give ChatKit a command palette inside the composer. They cover three related workflows:

- UI commands such as `/plan`
- Prompt workflow commands such as `/review src/app.ts`
- Runtime capability selection for skills, plugins, and sub-agents

Command execution does not bypass the normal ChatKit and Xpert request flow. Submitted prompts still go through `stream.submit`, runtime capability allow-lists still apply, and command metadata is added to the submitted human input for auditing and debugging.

## User Experience

When a user types `/` at the beginning of the composer, ChatKit opens the slash palette and shows:

- built-in ChatKit commands
- host-provided static commands from `composer.slashCommands`
- Xpert runtime commands from `runtimeCapabilities.commands`
- expandable Skills, Plugins, and Sub-agents groups for selecting runtime capabilities

When a user types `/` after whitespace in the middle of a message, ChatKit only shows runtime capabilities. Selecting a skill, plugin, or sub-agent inserts an atomic token into the contenteditable composer. The token:

- renders with the capability icon or avatar
- cannot be partially edited
- is deleted as a whole with Backspace or Delete
- is included in the displayed human message after submit
- contributes a run-only runtime capability allow-list for the next request
- is cleared after the request is sent

When a user types `$`, ChatKit opens the same runtime capability selector filtered to Skills only. Skill search also matches `$`-prefixed skill IDs and labels, so `$review` can select a skill whose ID or label is `review`.

The palette supports mouse selection plus keyboard navigation with Escape, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Tab, and Enter. Active keyboard navigation keeps the selected item scrolled into view.

## Command Sources

Commands are resolved in this order:

1. Built-in commands
2. Host static commands from `ChatKitOptions.composer.slashCommands`
3. Xpert runtime commands from `RuntimeCapabilitiesResponse.commands`

Built-in names are reserved. Host commands win over runtime commands with the same name. Duplicate commands are hidden and ChatKit logs a `console.warn`.

Command names do not include the leading `/`. Valid names use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores:

```text
review
security-review
test_file
```

## Public Types

Host applications can provide static commands through `ChatKitOptions`:

```ts
import type { ChatKitOptions } from '@xpert-ai/chatkit';

const options: ChatKitOptions = {
  composer: {
    slashCommands: [
      {
        name: 'review',
        label: 'Review',
        description: 'Review selected files',
        argsHint: '<path>',
        kind: 'prompt_workflow',
        workflow: {
          type: 'prompt_workflow',
          tags: ['quality'],
        },
        action: {
          type: 'submit_prompt',
          template: 'Review this code: {{args}}',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Runtime commands use the same shape in `RuntimeCapabilitiesResponse.commands`:

```ts
type RuntimeCapabilitiesResponse = {
  skills: RuntimeCapabilitySkill[];
  plugins: RuntimeCapabilityPlugin[];
  subAgents?: RuntimeCapabilitySubAgent[];
  commands?: RuntimeSlashCommand[];
};
```

## Command Shape

```ts
type ChatKitSlashCommand = {
  name: string;
  label?: string;
  description?: string;
  icon?: string | Record<string, unknown>;
  category?: string;
  aliases?: string[];
  argsHint?: string;
  availability?: {
    disabled?: boolean;
    reason?: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
  kind?: 'command' | 'prompt_workflow';
  workflow?: {
    type: 'prompt_workflow';
    name?: string;
    label?: string;
    description?: string;
    tags?: string[];
  };
  action: ChatKitSlashCommandAction;
  source?: Record<string, unknown>;
  meta?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

`category`, `aliases`, `argsHint`, `kind`, and `workflow` are optional. They are used for palette grouping, search, display, and submission metadata.

## Action Types

ChatKit supports five command action types.

### `insert_text`

Renders a template and writes it into the composer without submitting.

```ts
{
  name: 'draft-review',
  action: {
    type: 'insert_text',
    template: 'Please review {{args}} for correctness.',
  },
}
```

### `insert_invocation`

Writes a slash invocation such as `/review ` into the composer and leaves final submission to the server. This is useful for prompt workflows that should keep the user's raw `/command args` text until backend expansion.

```ts
{
  name: 'review',
  kind: 'prompt_workflow',
  action: {
    type: 'insert_invocation',
    template: '/review ',
  },
}
```

### `submit_prompt`

Renders a template and submits it as a user message. `{{args}}` is replaced by the text after the command name.

```ts
{
  name: 'review',
  kind: 'prompt_workflow',
  action: {
    type: 'submit_prompt',
    template: 'Review {{args}}',
    runtimeCapabilities: {
      mode: 'allowlist',
      skills: { ids: ['skill-review'] },
      plugins: { nodeKeys: [] },
      subAgents: { nodeKeys: [] },
    },
  },
}
```

Submitting `/review src/app.ts` sends `Review src/app.ts`.

If `runtimeCapabilities` is present on the action, ChatKit merges it into the current run-only capability selection for that submit.

### `client_action`

Notifies the host application through the parent bridge.

```ts
{
  name: 'open-ticket',
  action: {
    type: 'client_action',
    action: {
      type: 'tickets.open',
      payload: { source: 'chat' },
    },
  },
}
```

ChatKit sends the action as an `onWidgetAction` command with a `slash_command` widget item. Built-in UI commands also use `client_action` internally, but ChatKit handles their low-risk behavior directly.

### `select_capability`

Selects a runtime skill, plugin, or sub-agent.

```ts
{
  name: 'code-reviewer',
  action: {
    type: 'select_capability',
    capability: {
      type: 'skill',
      id: 'skill-review',
    },
  },
}
```

When the capability is available in the current runtime capability response, ChatKit inserts an atomic composer token. If the palette option is not currently loaded, ChatKit still updates the run-only capability allow-list.

## Built-in Commands

| Command          | Behavior                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/plan`          | Toggles plan mode.                                 |
| `/plan <prompt>` | Submits `<prompt>` with `planMode: true`.          |
| `/skills`        | Expands the Skills group in the slash palette.     |
| `/plugins`       | Expands the Plugins group in the slash palette.    |
| `/subagents`     | Expands the Sub-agents group in the slash palette. |

## Prompt Workflow Commands

Prompt workflows are slash commands that turn a short command invocation into a structured prompt. They are the ChatKit and Xpert equivalent of commands such as `/review`, `/explain`, `/test`, and `/debug`.

A prompt workflow command should use:

- `action.type: 'submit_prompt'`
- `kind: 'prompt_workflow'`
- optional `workflow` metadata for display, search, analytics, and debugging
- optional `runtimeCapabilities` to pin the skill or tool context required by the workflow

Example:

```ts
{
  name: 'security-review',
  label: 'Security Review',
  description: 'Review code for security issues',
  argsHint: '<path>',
  category: 'prompt_workflow',
  kind: 'prompt_workflow',
  workflow: {
    type: 'prompt_workflow',
    tags: ['security', 'code'],
  },
  action: {
    type: 'submit_prompt',
    template: 'Run a security review for {{args}}. Return findings by severity.',
  },
}
```

## Submission Payload

When a command submits a prompt, ChatKit writes command metadata to both the request input and `state.human`.

Example for `/review src/app.ts`:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "input": "Review src/app.ts",
    "runtimeCapabilities": {
      "mode": "allowlist",
      "skills": { "workspaceId": "workspace_123", "ids": ["skill-review"] },
      "plugins": { "nodeKeys": [] },
      "subAgents": { "nodeKeys": [] }
    },
    "commandSource": {
      "type": "slash_command",
      "name": "review",
      "source": "runtime",
      "executionType": "submit_prompt",
      "kind": "prompt_workflow",
      "workflow": {
        "type": "prompt_workflow",
        "name": "review",
        "label": "Review",
        "description": "Review selected files"
      }
    }
  },
  "state": {
    "human": {
      "input": "Review src/app.ts",
      "commandSource": {
        "type": "slash_command",
        "name": "review",
        "source": "runtime",
        "executionType": "submit_prompt",
        "kind": "prompt_workflow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This metadata is informational. Xpert should still enforce normal assistant access, skill access, plugin access, and runtime capability allow-list rules.

## Xpert Runtime Commands

Xpert can expose commands from installed skill packages through:

```http
GET /ai/assistants/:id/runtime-capabilities
```

Skill packages declare commands in `metadata.commands`. The Xpert server validates them before returning them to ChatKit:

- invalid names are discarded
- unknown action types are discarded
- empty `insert_text`, `insert_invocation`, and `submit_prompt` templates are discarded
- unsafe capability selection is discarded
- returned command runtime capabilities are restricted to the owning installed skill
- `submit_prompt` skill commands are normalized as prompt workflow commands

For details on runtime skills and plugin selection, see [Runtime Skills and Plugins Selection](./runtime-capabilities.md).

## Compatibility

- If the runtime capability endpoint does not return `commands`, ChatKit still shows built-in and host commands.
- If a host app does not configure `composer.slashCommands`, built-in commands and runtime capability selection still work.
- Existing programmatic `sendUserMessage` calls are unchanged unless the caller provides command metadata manually.
- Command execution never runs arbitrary shell commands.
- Commands cannot bypass Xpert permissions, tool preferences, or runtime capability allow-lists.

## Testing Checklist

Recommended coverage:

- `/` at message start shows commands plus capabilities.
- `/` after whitespace shows capabilities only.
- built-in names cannot be overridden.
- host commands win over runtime command name conflicts.
- `{{args}}` renders correctly for `insert_text`, `insert_invocation`, and `submit_prompt`.
- `insert_invocation` submits the raw `/command args` input for backend expansion.
- `submit_prompt` sends `input.commandSource`.
- prompt workflows include `kind: 'prompt_workflow'` and workflow metadata.
- runtime command capability selections merge into the submitted allow-list.
- selected skill, plugin, and sub-agent tokens render with real icons or avatars.
- atomic composer tokens cannot be partially edited and delete as a whole.
- Chinese IME composition does not trigger broken input updates.
- palette keyboard navigation scrolls the active item into view.
